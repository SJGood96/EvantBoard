# evantboard
This was a group effort that I had to do in The Software Guild. I was in charge of the CSS styling of the pages which I collaborated with the team to gain ideas on what they wanted the pages to look like. In the end we made things look like a post it note that was put on boards like what you would see in coffee shops.
